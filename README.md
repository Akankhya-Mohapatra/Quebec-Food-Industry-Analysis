# Quebec-Food-Industry-Analysis

Input webpage URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_towns_in_Quebec 

Known for its delicious multi-cultural cuisines, Quebec food industry has a huge potential for business expansion. I aim here to contribute towards this prospect and begin by scraping a wikipedia page containing list of all towns in Quebec province. I utilize the gathered data to understand the Food Business Sector and put forth possible suggestions for profitable invesments to expand the industry.


I have used unsupervised clustering: K-Means for data visualization and analysis of various clusters. It achieves successful grouping of data points into three non-overlapping clusters which makes it one of the most credulous clustering algorithms.
